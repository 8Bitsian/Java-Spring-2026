Class Chapter 2 Notes

An algorithm is pseudocode that outlines the application workflow

Comments are ignored by the compiler and give context for lines

Reading input from the console enables the program to accept input from the user
Java does this using a Scanner object
Importing packages allows java to use objects outside the base package

Identifiers are the names that identify elements like classes, methods, and variables
An identifier is a sequence of characters (letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs($))
It must start with a letter, underscore. or a dollar sign; CANNOT START W/DIGIT or ***
Identifiers cannot be a reserved word (Appendix A, ~50 words)
It can be of any length, so you can be as descriptive as need be

Variables are used to represent values that may be changed in the program
A variable must be declared prior to assigning a values
When possible, declare a variable and assign its initial value in one step

An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable.
"=" is the assignment operator in Java
An expression represents a computation involving values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a value

variable = value;

int y = 1;              // Assign 1 to variable y
double radius = 1.0;    // Assign 1.0 to variable radius
int x = 5 * ( 3 / 2);   // Expression is assigned to x
x = y + 1;              // Value of (y+1) is assigned to x

Variables can be used on both sides of the assignment operator
x = x + 1; // Increments by 1

A named constant is an identifier that represent a permanent value
A constant must be declared and initialized in the same statement.
The word "final" is a Java keyword for declaring a constant.

final datatype CONSTANT_NAME = value;

Value cannot change for named constant variable types.

Sticking w/Java naming conventions makes your programs easy to read and avoid errors
Choose descriptive names w/straightforward meanings for the variables, constants, classes, and methods
 - Use initial camelCase for variables and methods
 - Use initial uppercase and camelCase for classes
 - Use uppercase for constants

 Java has six numeric types for integers and floating-point numbers w/operators +, -, *, /, %
 - Integers: byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)
 - Floating-Point: float (32-bit), double (64-bit)
 - Addition (+)
 - Subtraction (-)
 - Multiplication (*)
 - (Integer) Division (/)
 - Modulus (Remainder Division) (%)

 Math.pow(a,b) raises a to the b power

 System.out.println(Math.pow(2,3));     // Displays 8.0
 System.out.println(Math.pow(4,0.5));   // Displays 4.0

A literal is a constant value that appears directly in a program.
Can be used for all numeric data types

int numOfYears = 34;
double weight = 0.305;

JShell is a command line tool for quickly evaluating an expression and executing a statement
Can be launched from the command line and integrated into IntelliJ
Use this to test your code prior to implementing

jshell> int x = 5;
x ==> 5
jshell> System.out.println(Math.pow(x, 3));
125.0
jshell> /vars
int = 5
jshell> /x

Java expressions are evaluated in the same way as arithmetic expressions (PEMDAS)
Parentheses Multiplication division remainder addition subtraction

The operators +, -, *, /, and % can be combined with the assignment operator (=) to form augmented operators
Java allows you to combine assignment and addition operators using an augmented (or compound) assignment operator

count = count + 1
count += 1

+=, -=, *=, /=, %=

The augmented operator is performed last after all the other operators in the expression are operated
PEMDAS ==> _=

x /= 4 + 5.5 * 1.5; ==> x = x / (4 + 5.5 * 1.5);

The increment (++) and decrement (--) operator are for incrementing and decrementing a variable
Postfix operations are pronounced "i plus-plus" or "i minus-minus"
Prefix operations evaluate first and updates the variable

++x preincrement
int j = ++i; // j is 2, i is 2
x++ postincrement
int j = i++; // j is 1, i is 2

--x predecrement
int j = --i; // j is 0, i is 0
x-- postdecrement
int j = i--; // j is 1, i is 0

Numeric Type Conversions and Casting
Floating-point numbers can be converted into integers using explicit casting
 - If one of the operands is a double/float/long, the other is converted into that data type
 - Otherwise, both operands are converted into int/short/byte accordingly

"Casting" is an operation that converts a value to one data type to another
Casting a type w/small range to large range is called "widening" a type
Casting a type w/large range to small range is called "shortening" a type

Explicit casting is achieved by prepending the datatype in parentheses:
System.out.println((int) 1.7);      // Shortens to 1
System.out.println((double) 1 / 2); // Widens to 0.5

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a multistage process that includes requirements specification,
analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance

Common Error 1: Undeclared/Uninitialized/Unused variables
Common Error 2: Integer Overflow
Common Error 3: Round-off Errors
Common Error 4: Unintended Integer Division
Common Pitfall 1: Redundant Input Objects
