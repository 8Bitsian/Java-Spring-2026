Class Chapter 4 Notes

This chapter introduces mathematical functions, characters, String objects. and uses them to develop programs

Common Mathematical Functions
Class Constants:
- PI: π - 3.14
- e: e = 2.71
Class Methods:
- Trigonometric: sin(rads), cos(rads), tan(rads), toRadians, toDegrees, asin(a), acos(a), atan(a)
- Exponent: exp(x), log(x), log10(x), pow(a, b), sqrt(x)
- Rounding: ceil(x) (up nearest int -> double), floor(x) (down nearest int -> double), rint(x), round(x)
- min(a,b), max(a,b), abs(a)
- random()

char is used to represent a single character which are stored as a sequence of binary values (0s and 1s)
Encoding is mapping the character to its binary representation

ASCII works for basic English and Unicode makes Java global-ready

ASCII (char letter = 'A'; char numChar = '4';)
- 128 characters
- English letters and digits
- Basic symbols
- No emojis
- No non-english langauges

Unicode (char letter = '\u0041'; char numChar = '\u0034'; string S = "Hello 🌎";)
- All langauges and symbols
- Uses code points
- Supports emojis
- Global-ready

The ASCII Character Set and Hexademical Index
- Fourth row, First coloumn = A, hence 0041
- Third row, Fourth coloumn = 4, hence 0034

Escape Sequences
- Backspace: \b or \u0008
- Tab: \t or \u0009
- Linefeed: \n or \u000A
- Formfeed: \f or \u000C
- Carriage Return: \r or \u000D
- Backslash: \\ or \u005C
- Double Quote: \" or \u0022

A char can cast into any numeric type and vice versa.
When an integer is cast into a, only its lower 16 bits of data are used; The other part is ignored

// Note a hex integer is written using prefix 0X
char ch1 = (char)0XAB0041; // The lower 16 bits hex code 0041 is assigned to ch
char ch2 = (char)65.25; // Decimal 65 assigned to ch
System.out.println(ch1); // ch is character A
System.out.println(ch2);

Two characters can be compared using the relation operators like comparing two numbers
- 'a' < 'b' is true because a = 97 and b = 98
- 'a' < 'A' is false because a = 97 and A = 65
- '1' < '8' is true because '1' = 49 and '8' = 59

Wrapper class Character has convenience methods for tesing and comparison
Simple Methods for String Objects
- length() : Returns number of characters in string
- charAt(index) : Returns character at specific index
- concat(s1) : concatenates two string together
- toUpperCase() / toLowerCase() : Returns new string w/all letters uppercase/lowercase
- trim() : Returns new string w/out leading and trailing whitespace
