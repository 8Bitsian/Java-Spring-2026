Class Chapter 5 Notes

This chapter introduces loops (repeating structures)

while loop
control a loop w/sentinel value

Repetitive tasks can be automated via repeating stuructures (loops).
Loops are construcuts that control repeated executions of a block of statements.
The concepts of looping is funadmental to programming
Java provides three types of loops:
- while loops, do-while loops, and for loops

Looping Design Strategies:
- Identify statements that need to be repeated
- Wrap those statements in the loop
- Add the logic that controls the loop:
  - Evaluated conditions
  - User Input controlled loops 
  - Sentinel Value controlled loops (menus)

Introducing While Loops
Syntax: while (loop-continuation-condition) { loop body; ...; }
Each execution of the loop body is called an iteration.

diamond decision-structure (boolean)
if false { ignore statements } else {process statements}

int count = 0;
while (count < 100) {
  System.out.println("Welcome to Java");
  count++; // postfix increment n += 1
}

Introducing Do-While Loops
Syntax:
do {
  loop-body;
  ...;
} while (loop-continuation-condition);

Introducing For Loops
Syntax:
for (initial-action; loop-continuation-condition; action-after-each-iteration) {
  // Loop body;
  ...;
}

int i;
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  System.out.println("Welecome to Java!");
}

OR

(more preferable)
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  System.out.println("Welecome to Java!");
}

Which Loop to Use?
The 3 forms of loop statements, while, do-wdile, and for are expressibely equivalent; that is you can write any loop in each form. Use the one that is most intuitive and comformatable for you.
- A while loop may be used if the number of repetitions is not known
- A do-whiele loop can be used to repalce a while loop if the loop body have to be executed priot to testing

Nested Loops
Nested loops consist of an outer loop and one or more inner loops.
Each time the outer loop is repeated, the inner loops are reented, and started anew.

Additional Controls w/in Loops
Keywords break and continue are additonal controls within loops
- Use break in a loop to immeadielty termnate the loop
- Continue ends the current iteration and program controls goes to the end of the loop body
