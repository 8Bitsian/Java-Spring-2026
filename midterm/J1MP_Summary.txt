Directions:
- Summarize each question to gain a clear understanding of the underlying issue
- Specify the input data type and provide sample inputs and outputs for comprehension and problem identification

PART 1 - CALCULATING SALES
==========================
An online retailer sells 5 products whose retail prices are as follows:
- Product 1: $2.98
- Product 2: $4.50
- Product 3: $9.98
- Product 4: $4.49
- Product 5: $6.87

Write an application that reads a series of a pair of numbers as follows:
- Product Number
- Quantitiy Sold

Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product.
It should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.
Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.

PART 2 - ACCOUNT SAVING CHECKING
==========================
A bank in your towns updates its customers' accounts at the end of each month.
The bank offers two types of accounts: Savings and Checking.
Every customer must maintain a minimum balance or they will be penalized with a service charge as follows:
- $10.00 for savings
- $25.00 for checking

If the balance at the end of the month is at least the minimum, the accout recieves iterest as follows:
- 4% interest for savings
- Checking accounts w/balanace of up to $5,000 more than the minumum recieve 3% interest; Otherwise, the interest is 5%

Write a program that reads:
- a customer’s account number (int type)
- account type (char type; S for savings and C for checking)
- minimum balance that the account should maintain
- current balance

The program should then output:
- The account number
- Account type
- Current balance and new balance
- Or an appropriate error message

Test your program by running it five times, by using proper the following data:
46728 S 1000 2700 
87324 C 1500 7689 
873 S 1000 800 
89832 C 2000 3000 
98322 C 1000 750

PART 3 - PARKING CHARGES
==========================
A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours.
The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time.

Write an application that calculates and displays the parking charges for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday.
You should enter the hours parked for each customer.
The program should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running total of yesterday’s receipts.
