   Midterm Project: Part 2 - Acount Saving Checking
   A bank in your towns updates its customers' accounts at the end of each month.
   The bank offers two types of accounts: Savings and Checking.
   Every customer must maintain a minimum balance or they will be penalized with a service charge as follows:
   - $10.00 for savings
   - $25.00 for checking

   If the balance at the end of the month is at least the minimum, the accout recieves iterest as follows:
   - 4% interest for savings
   - Checking accounts w/balanace of up to $5,000 more than the minumum recieve 3% interest; Otherwise, the interest is 5%

   Write a program that reads:
   - a customer’s account number (int type)
   - account type (char type; S for savings and C for checking)
   - minimum balance that the account should maintain
   - current balance

   The program should then output:
   - The account number
   - Account type
   - Current balance and new balance
   - Or an appropriate error message

   Test your program by running it five times, by using proper the following data:
   46728 S 1000 2700 
   87324 C 1500 7689 
   873 S 1000 800 
   89832 C 2000 3000 
   98322 C 1000 750
